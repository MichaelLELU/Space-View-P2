# ðŸ’« About:

For our second project at the Wild Code School, we created an image gallery using the NASA API. This gallery is accessible to everyone, featuring categories and a search bar that allow users to explore space. We worked in a team of four, employing the Agile methodology to develop the project. The entire project was completed in three weeks.
